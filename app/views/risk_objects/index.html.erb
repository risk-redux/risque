      <p><em>Bite-Sized Morsels of Risk</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.</p>
      <p>Risk objects represent instances of such measurements, as they apply to specific systems.</p>
      <p>Risqu√© offers the ability to create <i>threat-oriented</i>, <i>asset-oriented</i>, and <i>vulnerability-oriented</i> risk objects.</p>

        <h3>Threat-Oriented</h3>
        <p>A threat-oriented approach starts with the identification of threat sources and threat events, and focuses on the development of threat scenarios; vulnerabilities are identified in the context of threats, and for adversarial threats, impacts are identified based on adversary intent.</p>

        <h3>Asset-Oriented</h3>
        <p>An asset/impact-oriented approach starts with the identification of impacts or consequences of concern and critical assets, possibly using the results of a mission or business impact analyses31 and identifying threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impacts or consequences.</p>

        <h3>Vulnerability-Oriented</h3>
        <p>A vulnerability-oriented approach starts with a set of predisposing conditions or exploitable weaknesses/deficiencies in organizational information systems or the environments in which the systems operate, and identifies threat events that could exercise those vulnerabilities.</p>
