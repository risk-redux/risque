# Welcome to risquè!

Modeling risks and documenting problems within system boundaries is a critical aspect of continuous monitoring, because you have to be able to communicate about what's wrong before you can fix anything. _[NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final)_ provides an approach to this conundrum and `risquè` provides an easy to use tool for leveraging those ideas into actual shareable content.
